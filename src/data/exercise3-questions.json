  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "relative-sizing",
      "question": "Story points are about relative sizing, not absolute time estimation.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Correct! Story points compare the relative effort/complexity between stories, not predict exact time. This makes them more reliable than time estimates.",
      "category": "Core Concept"
    },
    {
      "id": "fibonacci-sequence",
      "question": "The Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) is used because it reflects the increasing uncertainty in larger estimates.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Exactly! As stories get larger, our uncertainty grows exponentially. Fibonacci gaps reflect this natural uncertainty progression.",
      "category": "Estimation Scale"
    },
    {
      "id": "time-estimation",
      "question": "A 5-point story should always take exactly 5 times longer than a 1-point story.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "Not necessarily! Story points reflect relative effort/complexity, but actual time can vary based on developer experience, interruptions, and other factors.",
      "category": "Common Misconception"
    },
    {
      "id": "three-factors",
      "question": "The three main factors in story point estimation are complexity, effort, and uncertainty.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Perfect! These three factors work together: complexity (how hard to understand/implement), effort (amount of work), and uncertainty (how much we don't know).",
      "category": "Estimation Factors"
    },
    {
      "id": "team-velocity",
      "question": "Team velocity should remain constant across all sprints.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "Velocity naturally fluctuates due to team changes, learning, holidays, and other factors. It's a planning tool, not a performance metric.",
      "category": "Velocity & Planning"
    },
    {
      "id": "individual-estimation",
      "question": "Story points should be estimated by individual developers working alone.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "Team estimation (like Planning Poker) is more accurate because it combines different perspectives and catches assumptions that individuals might miss.",
      "category": "Team Process"
    },
    {
      "id": "story-splitting",
      "question": "If a story is estimated at 21 points, it should be split into smaller stories.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Correct! Stories larger than 13 points are usually too big and uncertain. Splitting them reveals hidden complexity and improves estimation accuracy.",
      "category": "Story Management"
    },
    {
      "id": "velocity-comparison",
      "question": "You can directly compare velocity between different teams to measure productivity.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "Never compare velocities between teams! Each team's points are relative to their context, skills, and definition of done. It's like comparing different currencies.",
      "category": "Common Mistake"
    }
