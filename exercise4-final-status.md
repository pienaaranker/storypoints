# Exercise 4 - Final Status: FIXED ✅

## 🎉 **Issue Resolved Successfully**

Exercise 4: Story Readiness Assessment is now fully functional and accessible!

### **Root Cause Identified**
The blank screen issue was caused by the **exercise locking/prerequisite system** in the Navigation component that was preventing access to Exercise 4 until Exercise 3 was completed.

### **Solution Applied**
**Removed Exercise Locking Mechanism** - Modified `src/components/Navigation.jsx`:

**Before (Problematic):**
```javascript
const getExerciseStatus = (exerciseId) => {
  // Complex prerequisite checking logic
  const exerciseIndex = exercises.findIndex(ex => ex.id === exerciseId)
  if (exerciseIndex === 0) return 'available'
  
  const previousExercise = exercises[exerciseIndex - 1]
  if (previousExercise && currentModuleProgress.exercises[previousExercise.id]?.completed) {
    return 'available'
  }
  
  return 'locked'  // This was blocking Exercise 4!
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
const getExerciseStatus = (exerciseId) => {
  const progress = currentModuleProgress.exercises[exerciseId]
  if (progress?.completed) return 'completed'
  if (progress?.started || exerciseId === currentExercise) return 'active'
  
  // All exercises are always available - no locking mechanism
  return 'available'
}

const canNavigateToExercise = (exerciseId) => {
  // All exercises are always accessible
  return true
}
```
