# Card-Based Point Selection Test

## Test Objectives
Verify that the new card-based point selection interface works correctly and provides a better user experience than the previous dropdown.

## Test Cases

### Visual Design
- [ ] Point values are displayed as horizontal cards (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- [ ] All point options are visible simultaneously without dropdown interaction
- [ ] Cards have consistent sizing and spacing
- [ ] Cards have proper hover effects

### Selection Behavior
- [ ] Single click on a card selects that point value
- [ ] Clicking on an already selected card deselects it (toggle behavior)
- [ ] Only one point value can be selected at a time per story/item
- [ ] Selection state persists when navigating between items

### Visual Feedback
- [ ] Selected cards have clear visual indication (different background/border)
- [ ] Hover states provide visual feedback
- [ ] Unselected cards return to default state when another is selected

### Accessibility
- [ ] Cards are keyboard navigable (Tab key)
- [ ] Enter/Space keys activate card selection
- [ ] Cards have appropriate ARIA labels
- [ ] Screen readers can identify selected state

### Functionality Integration
- [ ] Exercise 1: Point selection works in abstract items exercise
- [ ] Exercise 2: Point selection works in user stories exercise
- [ ] Submit buttons remain disabled until all items have points assigned
- [ ] Deselecting a card properly removes the point assignment
- [ ] Exercise completion logic still works correctly

### Responsive Design
- [ ] Cards display properly on mobile devices
- [ ] Card layout adapts to smaller screens
- [ ] Touch interactions work on mobile
