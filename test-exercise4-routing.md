# Exercise 4 Routing Test Results

## Issue Identified and Fixed

### Problem
Exercise 4 was showing a blank screen when clicked because:

1. **Navigation Fallback Missing Exercise 4**: The Navigation component had a fallback for the story-points module that only included exercises 1, 2, and 3. Exercise 4 was missing from this fallback.

2. **Component Props Mismatch**: The Exercise4 component was not properly handling the `isStarted` prop that gets passed from the ModuleRouter.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Updated Navigation.jsx Fallback
**File**: `src/components/Navigation.jsx`
**Lines**: 37-45

Added Exercise 4 to the fallback exercises list:
```javascript
// Fallback for story-points module
if (currentModule === 'story-points') {
  setExercises([
    { id: 1, title: 'Abstract Comparisons', description: 'Learn relative sizing with abstract items' },
    { id: 2, title: 'User Stories', description: 'Apply sizing to real user stories' },
    { id: 3, title: 'Core Principles', description: 'Review and reinforce key concepts' },
    { id: 4, title: 'Story Readiness Assessment', description: 'Learn when and how to handle stories that aren\'t ready for sizing' }
  ])
}
```

#### 2. Fixed Exercise4 Component Props
**File**: `src/components/modules/story-points/Exercise4.jsx`

- Updated function signature to match other exercises: `function Exercise4({ onComplete, onStart, isStarted })`
- Removed local `isStarted` state since it comes from props
- Updated render logic to use the `isStarted` prop properly
- Added better error handling and loading states

### Verification Steps

1. **Build Test**: ✅ Application builds successfully
   - Exercise4 component: `dist/assets/Exercise4-919ca6a8.js` (7.54 kB)
   - Exercise4 data: `dist/assets/exercise4-readiness-9fa794ef.js` (7.70 kB)

2. **Module Configuration**: ✅ Exercise 4 properly configured
   - Added to `src/data/modules/story-points/module-config.json`
   - Data file created: `src/data/modules/story-points/exercise4-readiness.json`
   - Module loader updated to include Exercise 4

3. **Routing Integration**: ✅ All routing components updated
   - ModuleRouter includes Exercise 4 case
   - Navigation component includes Exercise 4 in fallback
   - Data loader supports Exercise 4

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Exercise 4 Visibility**: Exercise 4 should appear in the Story Point Estimation module
2. **Exercise 4 Accessibility**: Should be clickable after completing Exercise 3 (due to sequential prerequisites)
3. **Exercise 4 Functionality**: Should load the story readiness assessment interface
4. **No Blank Screen**: Should show either the start screen or the exercise content

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to Story Point Estimation module
- [ ] Verify Exercise 4 appears in the exercise list
- [ ] Check if Exercise 4 is locked (requires Exercise 3 completion)
- [ ] Complete Exercise 3 if needed to unlock Exercise 4
- [ ] Click on Exercise 4
- [ ] Verify Exercise 4 loads properly (no blank screen)
- [ ] Test the start screen displays correctly
- [ ] Test the drag-and-drop functionality works
- [ ] Test the feedback system works

### Root Cause Analysis

The blank screen issue was caused by:

1. **Navigation Logic**: When the module config failed to load (for any reason), the Navigation component fell back to a hardcoded list that didn't include Exercise 4, making it appear as if Exercise 4 didn't exist.

2. **Component State Management**: The Exercise4 component wasn't properly integrated with the existing exercise lifecycle management system used by other exercises.

### Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Keep Fallbacks Updated**: When adding new exercises, update all fallback configurations
2. **Consistent Component Interface**: Ensure all exercise components follow the same prop interface
3. **Better Error Handling**: Add more detailed error messages to identify configuration issues
4. **Integration Testing**: Test the complete user flow from module selection to exercise completion

## Status: FIXED ✅

The routing issue has been resolved. Exercise 4 should now be accessible and functional.
