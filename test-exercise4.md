- [ ] Progress indicator shows correct count of categorized stories
- [ ] Submit button is disabled until all stories are categorized
- [ ] Submit button becomes enabled when all stories are placed
- [ ] Feedback screen displays:
  - [ ] Overall accuracy score
  - [ ] Detailed feedback for each story
  - [ ] Correct/incorrect indicators
  - [ ] Explanations for each story's correct category
  - [ ] Techniques for handling incorrectly categorized stories
- [ ] Complete button works and advances to next exercise or module overview

### Story Categories Test Cases

#### Ready to Size Stories:
- [ ] "User Login" - Clear requirements, appropriate scope
- [ ] "Password Reset Functionality" - Well-defined, standard feature
- [ ] "Product Search" - Clear acceptance criteria, appropriate complexity

#### Too Vague Stories:
- [ ] "Improve System Performance" - No specific metrics or targets
- [ ] "AI Integration" - Extremely vague, no specific features defined
- [ ] "Third-party Integration" - No specific service identified

#### Too Large Stories:
- [ ] "Complete E-commerce Platform" - Epic-sized, multiple features
- [ ] "Mobile Application" - Multiple platforms, months of work

#### Too Small Stories:
- [ ] "Fix Typo in Button Text" - Trivial change, minutes of work
- [ ] "Update Button Color" - Simple CSS change

### Learning Objectives Verification
- [ ] Users learn to identify stories that lack sufficient detail
- [ ] Users understand when stories are too complex and need breakdown
- [ ] Users recognize over-decomposed stories that should be combined
- [ ] Users learn specific techniques for handling each scenario type
- [ ] Exercise reinforces story point estimation principles from previous exercises

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] React components render without errors
- [ ] CSS imports resolve correctly
- [ ] @dnd-kit drag and drop library functions properly
- [ ] Data loading works correctly
- [ ] State management works across component lifecycle
- [ ] Exercise integrates properly with module navigation
- [ ] Progress tracking works correctly
- [ ] No console errors during exercise execution

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Smooth drag and drop interactions
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for drag states
- [ ] Consistent styling with other exercises
- [ ] Loading states display appropriately
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Exercise appears in module configuration
- [ ] Data loader functions work correctly
- [ ] Module router handles Exercise 4 properly
- [ ] Progress manager tracks Exercise 4 completion
- [ ] Navigation between exercises works smoothly

## Expected Learning Outcomes

After completing Exercise 4, users should be able to:

1. **Identify Unready Stories**: Recognize stories that lack sufficient detail, have unclear requirements, or have unresolved dependencies
2. **Recognize Oversized Stories**: Identify stories that are too complex (typically above 8-13 story points) and understand decomposition techniques
3. **Spot Over-decomposed Stories**: Recognize when stories are too small (typically 1 point or less) and should be combined
4. **Apply Practical Techniques**: Use specific techniques for handling each type of story readiness issue
5. **Make Better Estimation Decisions**: Understand when to estimate vs. when to defer until stories are properly prepared

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All drag and drop interactions work smoothly
- [ ] Feedback is educational and actionable
- [ ] Exercise integrates seamlessly with existing module flow
- [ ] Users can successfully categorize at least 70% of stories correctly
- [ ] Exercise completion advances user progress appropriately
- [ ] No technical errors or broken functionality
