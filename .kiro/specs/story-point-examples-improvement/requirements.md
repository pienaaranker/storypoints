# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the story point estimation examples in the Agile Mastery Hub to better align with Scrum best practices. The current examples have several issues that could mislead learners about proper story sizing, estimation practices, and when stories should be broken down further.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Realistic Story Size Distribution

**User Story:** As a learner using the story point estimation module, I want to see realistic story size distributions so that I understand proper story breakdown practices in real Scrum teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing story point examples THEN the majority of stories SHALL be sized between 1-8 points
2. WHEN a story is sized above 8 points THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on story breakdown
3. WHEN stories are presented THEN they SHALL reflect realistic complexity distributions (more small stories than large ones)
4. WHEN examples include 13+ point stories THEN they SHALL be marked as "needs breakdown" with explanation

### Requirement 2: Context-Aware Story Examples

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to see story point examples that consider different team contexts so that I understand how team experience and domain knowledge affect estimation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing story examples THEN they SHALL include team context information (experience level, domain knowledge, technical stack)
2. WHEN the same story is shown to different team contexts THEN it SHALL demonstrate how points can vary based on team capabilities
3. WHEN examples show estimation variance THEN they SHALL explain the reasoning behind different team estimates
4. WHEN presenting cross-team scenarios THEN they SHALL emphasize that velocity comparison between teams is meaningless

### Requirement 3: Story Breakdown Scenarios

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to practice breaking down large stories into smaller ones so that I can apply proper story decomposition techniques in real projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering stories larger than 8 points THEN the system SHALL provide interactive breakdown exercises
2. WHEN breaking down stories THEN learners SHALL practice multiple decomposition techniques (by workflow, by data, by acceptance criteria, by complexity)
3. WHEN breakdown is complete THEN the system SHALL validate that resulting stories are appropriately sized (1-8 points)
4. WHEN showing breakdown examples THEN they SHALL demonstrate how breakdown reveals hidden complexity and dependencies

### Requirement 4: Non-Estimable Work Examples

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to understand when work should not be estimated with story points so that I can identify spikes, research, and other non-estimable activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing estimation exercises THEN they SHALL include examples of work that shouldn't be estimated (research spikes, proof of concepts, learning activities)
2. WHEN non-estimable work is presented THEN the system SHALL explain why story points don't apply
3. WHEN spikes are shown THEN they SHALL be time-boxed with clear learning objectives
4. WHEN research activities are included THEN they SHALL demonstrate how to transition from spike to estimable stories

### Requirement 5: Relative Sizing Consistency

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to practice maintaining relative sizing consistency across different story types so that I can help my team develop shared understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN estimating multiple stories THEN the system SHALL validate relative sizing consistency
2. WHEN inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on relative relationships
3. WHEN stories span different technical areas THEN examples SHALL show how to maintain consistency across domains
4. WHEN new story types are introduced THEN the system SHALL guide learners through establishing new reference points

### Requirement 6: Real-World Estimation Challenges

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to encounter realistic estimation challenges so that I'm prepared for common scenarios in actual Scrum teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN practicing estimation THEN scenarios SHALL include stories with high uncertainty
2. WHEN uncertainty is high THEN the system SHALL demonstrate techniques for handling unknowns (spikes, research, conservative estimates)
3. WHEN dependencies exist THEN examples SHALL show how external dependencies affect estimation
4. WHEN technical debt impacts stories THEN scenarios SHALL demonstrate how to account for additional complexity

### Requirement 7: Team Estimation Simulation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to experience collaborative estimation techniques so that I understand the value of team-based estimation over individual estimates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning estimation THEN exercises SHALL simulate Planning Poker or similar collaborative techniques
2. WHEN estimates diverge significantly THEN the system SHALL facilitate discussion scenarios
3. WHEN consensus is reached THEN the system SHALL highlight how discussion improves estimate quality
4. WHEN individual vs team estimates are compared THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the accuracy benefits of collaboration

### Requirement 8: Progressive Complexity Learning

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to progress from simple to complex estimation scenarios so that I can build confidence and skills gradually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting estimation exercises THEN they SHALL begin with clear, unambiguous stories
2. WHEN progressing through exercises THEN complexity SHALL increase gradually (clear → ambiguous → high uncertainty)
3. WHEN advanced scenarios are reached THEN they SHALL include multiple complexity factors simultaneously
4. WHEN exercises are complete THEN learners SHALL have practiced the full spectrum of estimation challenges
