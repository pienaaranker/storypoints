# Story Point Master: Simple Interactive Web App Concept

## Introduction

"Story Point Master" is a straightforward, interactive web application designed to quickly teach the fundamental mindset behind story point estimation. It focuses on relative sizing and understanding effort over time through a few core exercises, providing immediate, clear feedback to build an intuitive grasp of agile estimation principles.

## Core Interactive Experience

The app will guide users through a concise, sequential learning path:

### 1. Relative Sizing: Abstract Comparisons

**Purpose:** To instill the core concept of relative sizing by detaching users from real-world time biases.

**How it Works:**
- Users are presented with a small set of highly abstract, unrelated items (e.g., "a grain of sand," "a pebble," "a boulder," "a mountain").
- They are asked to arrange these items in order of perceived "effort to move" or "complexity to build," or to assign simple relative "points" (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 8) to each, emphasizing that the numbers are arbitrary and only reflect relative scale.
- **Instant Feedback:** After each comparison, the app reveals a "model" ordering/sizing with a brief explanation focusing on the *relative difference* and why one item is considered significantly more "complex" or "effortful" than another.
- **Mindset Reinforcement:** A discrete memo at the bottom of the screen reinforces the lesson: "Story points are about *relative effort*, not absolute time. A '3' is roughly three times the effort of a '1'."

### 2. Applying Relative Sizing: Simple User Stories

**Purpose:** To bridge the gap from abstract concepts to practical application with simplified, mock user stories.

**How it Works:**
- Users are presented with 3-5 very simple, distinct mock user stories (e.g., "As a user, I want to see my profile," "As a user, I want to change my password," "As a user, I want to upload a profile picture").
- They are asked to **drag and drop these stories to arrange them in order of their relative size/effort**, from smallest to largest. After ordering, they will then be prompted to assign story points (e.g., from a Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8) to each story, considering the relative complexity, effort, and uncertainty compared to each other.
- **Instant Feedback & Explanation:** For each story, the app reveals a "model" story point estimate and, crucially, a brief explanation of the rationale. This explanation will highlight factors like:
  - **Complexity:** Is the underlying logic simple or intricate?
  - **Effort:** How much work is involved?
  - **Uncertainty/Risk:** Are there many unknowns or potential blockers?
- **Mindset Reinforcement:** A short message appears, like: "Notice how a small change in requirements can significantly increase complexity. Story points help us account for these nuances."

### 3. Core Principles Recap

**Purpose:** To summarize the key mindset shifts and principles learned through the exercises.

**How it Works:**
- A brief, static screen or a simple interactive quiz (e.g., true/false questions) reiterates the core tenets:
  - "Story points are not hours."
  - "Focus on effort, complexity, and risk."
  - "Embrace uncertainty; estimates are not commitments."
  - "Relative sizing is key."
- **Final Thought:** A concluding message encouraging the user to apply this mindset in their real-world estimations.

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist UI:** Clean, intuitive interface with clear calls to action.
- **Focus on Interaction:** Learning by doing is paramount.
- **Immediate & Clear Feedback:** Users should instantly understand the impact of their choices.
- **Concise Explanations:** Short, impactful text that reinforces principles without overwhelming.
- **No Persistence:** No user accounts, no saved progress, no streaks. Each visit is a fresh learning session.

This revised concept is much more aligned with a "simple but effective" interactive web app, focusing on the core educational value without the overhead of tracking or gamification.
